# Random Password Generator
## https://alexj1890.github.io/Week3-PasswordGenerator/
## Description
### Creates a random password with 8-128 characters. Clicking the "Generate Password" button will offer prompts for how many characters and what types of characters should be used.
### I want to add that I forgot to make this repository and was working on this project on my local machine and then when I reread the instructions I realized my mistake.
